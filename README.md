# hello-world
We're all new at some point. 

ABOUT ME
- Wants to be a back end developer because my personality won't allow me to be anything else, but am interested in UI and gaming, so maybe full stack. 
- I have a hard time building habits. 
- I know SQL and Python theory; practice is a different animal. 
- Some C++ experience.

Have fun out there!*/
